Skiers and riders, you’ve all seen these trail maps—they're essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next epic run. @cr-southface

In particular, this map, beautifully painted by the legendary [James Niehues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Niehues), is of the <span style="color: #FF8C42;">**South Face**</span> of Big Sky, Montana.

But have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are? In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor <span style="color: #FF8C42;">*southern*</span> exposure, or are they more often found on the <span style="color: #36B37E;">*north*</span> side of the mountain?

We began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org/), which refines [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails.

Here is a local favorite, Whaleback Mountain.

Analyzing this data, we could see how much *north-facing* each ski area is by looking at its "ski rose".

Take, for example, Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH.

Our analysis revealed a clear <span style="color: #36B37E;">poleward</span> and slight <span style="color: #FFC857;">eastward</span> bias in ski area slopes.
In other words, a majority of slopes in the northern atmosphere oriented toward the north and east. 


This trend likely reflects the desire to maximize <span style="color: #36B37E;">snow retention</span> and minimize <span style="color: #FFC857;">sun exposure</span>, ensuring better skiing conditions and longer seasons.
