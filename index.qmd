Skiers and riders, you’ve all seen these trail maps—they're essential for navigating the mountain, finding the fastest lift, or planning your next epic run. @cr-southface

In particular, this map, beautifully painted by the legendary [James Niehues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Niehues), is of the <span style="color: #FF8C42;">**South Face**</span> of Big Sky, Montana.

But have you ever wondered how common south-facing slopes are? In other words, do most ski trails in this hemisphere favor <span style="color: #FF8C42;">**southern**</span> exposure, or are they more often found on the <span style="color: #36B37E;">**north**</span> side of the mountain?

We began our journey to answer this question by gathering data from [OpenSkiMap](https://openskimap.org/), which refines [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) 
to create an amazing interactive visualization of the world and all its ski trails.

Here is a local favorite, Whaleback Mountain.

Analyzing this data, we could see how much *north-facing* each ski area is by looking at its "ski rose".

Take, for example, Dartmouth Skiway in Lyme, NH.

Our analysis of the slopes of *all* ski areas across the globe revealed a clear <span style="color: #36B37E;">poleward</span> and slight <span style="color: #FFC857;">eastward</span> bias.<br><br>
In other words, the majority of slopes in the <span style="color: #36B37E;">northern</span> hemisphere oriented toward the <span style="color: #36B37E;">north</span> and <span style="color: #FFC857;">east</span> ,
while those in the <span style="color: #36B37E;">southern</span> hemisphere are oriented toward the <span style="color: #36B37E;">south</span> and <span style="color: #FFC857;">east</span>.
@cr-hemisphere

This trend likely reflects the desire to maximize <span style="color: #36B37E;">snow retention</span> and minimize <span style="color: #FFC857;">sun exposure</span>, ensuring better skiing conditions and longer seasons.
